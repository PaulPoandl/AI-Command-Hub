# AI-Command-Hub

Introducing our AI library - an all-in-one solution for anyone looking to work with artificial intelligence and learn about them. Our Python app offers a range of AI engines, including OpenAI and also the Wolframalpha Library, along with a powerful chatbot system.

One unique feature is "Chatty," a chatbot that responds to trigger based sentence, making it easy to understand and work with chatbots -> so you have also the option to make "Chatty" more intellegent. Additionally, you can create your own chatbot with our Q&A Companion, where you can write your own answersheet and choose your preferred response.

Our app also includes a command window, where you can use various commands to execute different tasks, including using one of the AI engines to assist you in your work. The app is designed to make your life easier and also to learn how chat-systems work!

We believe that everyone should have access to the power of AI, and our library offers a simple and effective way to do just that. So why not give it a try? Get started today and explore the possibilities of AI!

# Open AI

The Programm contains the AI models Ada, Davinci, Babbage and Curie, supportage for other models will comen in teh future. Each of the OpenAI language models (Ada, Davinci, Babbage, and Curie) is designed to perform various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering. They are not whole models because they are part of a larger language model architecture that is trained on a vast amount of text data. Each model is fine-tuned to perform specific tasks and has its own unique capabilities and limitations based on its training data and parameters. Therefore, they cannot perform all natural language processing tasks perfectly, but they are still good enough!
