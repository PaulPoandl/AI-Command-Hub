# AI-Command-Hub

Introducing our AI library - an all-in-one solution for anyone looking to integrate artificial intelligence into their work. Our Python app offers a range of AI engines, including OpenAI and also the Wolframalpha Library, along with a powerful chatbot system.

One unique feature is "Chatty," a chatbot that responds to trigger based sentence, making it easy to understand and work with chatbot -> so you have also the option to make "Chatty" more intellegent. Additionally, you can create your own chatbot with our Q&A Companion, where you can write your own answersheet and choose your preferred response.

Our app also includes a command window, where you can use various commands to execute different tasks, including using one of the AI engines to assist you in your work. The app is designed to make your life easier and also to learn how chat-systems work!

We believe that everyone should have access to the power of AI, and our library offers a simple and effective way to do just that. So why not give it a try? Get started today and explore the possibilities of AI!
